#Clustered-social-network-protocol
Course Project for EEL5718
##### This project aims to implement DTN protocol described in "Socio-Geo: Social Network Routing Protocol in Delay Tolerant Networks". We use a square grid area as the areas, each nodes' moving partterns are simplified as only allowed to move along the grids. A simple multi-threading pool is used to accelerate the program.

##### Usage:
##### using randomewalk.py to create the input.txt with information of nodes and its moving parttern and messages between nodes.
##### running sample usage: ./run --rounds=100000 --debug=on
